---
## [0.9.1]
### Added
- Updated crate to Rust Edition 2021.
---
## [0.9.0]
### Changed
- Increased performance. Move generation and board updates are now hugely more performant and the legal move checker also got a small boost.
- Renamed `OthelloBoard::legal_moves_for(...)` to `OthelloBoard::moves_for(...)`.
- Rewrote some documentation tests to use `assert`-macros instead of simply printing values.
- Theoretically optimized `OthelloBoard::empty_squares()`.
---
## [0.8.0]
### Changed
- Renamed `OthelloBoard::empty_cells()` to `OthelloBoard::empty_squares()`.
### Fixed
- Documentation issue regarding `SquareExt`.
---
## [0.7.0]
### Added
- Added `OthelloBoard::display(...)` to pretty print the board.
- Added `SquareExt` to enumerate all positions on a bitboard.
### Changed
- Renamed `PositionExt` to `StoneExt`.
---
## [0.6.0]
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug in `OthelloBoard::is_legal_move(...)`. The position must be on an empty tile to be considered legal.
---
## [0.5.2]
### Fixed
- Broken links in the README was fixed.
---
## [0.5.1]
### Added
- Added a link to the benchmarks in the README.
- Added a description of the benchmarks.
- Added some example code walking through the most common operations.
---
## [0.5.0]
### Added
- Added `OthelloBoard::remove_stone_unchecked(...)`.
---
## [0.4.0]
### Added
- Added workflow to handle publishing to crates.io.

### Changed
- Reorganized the library to avoid repetitive imports.
  Before:
  ```rust
  magpie::othello_board::OthelloBoard;
  magpie::stone::Stone;
  ```
  After:
  ```rust
  magpie::othello::OthelloBoard;
  magpie::othello::Stone;
  ```
---
## [0.3.0]
### Added
- Example code was added, featuring a demonstration of how to use `serde` and a fully playable game where you are pit against an opponent who only makes random moves. As a result, the example code from the README was removed and a link to this new example was added.
- Implemented `TryFrom` and `Default` traits for `OthelloBoard`.

### Removed
- Removed `OthelloBoard::from_state(...)`. Replaced by `TryFrom` trait.

### Fixed
- An unsound deserialization bug was fixed, outlined in [#16].
- Documentation links have been updated to a better format, introduced in Rust 1.48.
---
## [0.2.0]
### Added
- An extension trait `PositionExt` has been added to simplify handling of bitboards.
- Added `OthelloBoard::is_legal_move(...)`.
- The OthelloBoard can now be constructed in three different ways
  - `OthelloBoard::new()` creates a completely empty board without any stones on it.
  - `OthelloBoard::standard()` returns a board with the starting position pre-filled.
  - `OthelloBoard::from_state(...)` creates a new board from the supplied positions. It returns an error if any of the positions overlap.
- An optional dependency on `serde` has been added.
- Significantly expanded the README.
- Included benchmarks.
- Expanded documentation.
### Changed
- Renamed function `OthelloBoard::free_spaces()` to `OthelloBoard::empty_cells()`.
- `OthelloBoard::place_stone(...)` now differentiates between two types of user error.
- `OthelloBoard::place_stone_unchecked(...)` is not entirely unchecked anymore. It needs to make sure that no stones overlap.
- `OthelloBoard::stone_at(...)` will now return `None` if supplied with a bitboard that does not have exactly one bit set.
