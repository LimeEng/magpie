    // ========================================================================

    // ========================================================================
    // It is also possible to construct a new board with the TryFrom trait.
    // It makes it possible to set the board to a custom state. The only check
    // that is performed is whether or not any black and white stones overlap.
    // Other than that, any configuration is allowed, even those that are
    // impossible to reach during normal play.

    // player overlap.

    // The bitboard is a pretty generic container for an `u64`. The
    // `.hot_bits()` function may be of particular interest, as it iterates
    // through all hot bits contained in the `Bitboard`. These bits are yielded
    // as if they were independent bitboards, and to conserve this invariant in
    // the type system, they are returned as `Position`. `Position` is similar
    // to `Bitboard` but they are guaranteed to always contain exactly one set
    // bit. Here, `.hot_bits()` is used to extract all legal moves.
    let mut positions = legal_moves.hot_bits();
    // Here it is verified that all legal moves extracted are indeed legal to
    // play.

    // ========================================================================
    // Sometimes it is necessary to take complete control of the game. The two
    // functions `place_stone_unchecked` and `remove_stone_unchecked` allows
    // you to both place and remove arbitrary stones without having to comply
    // with Othello's rules. Both functions will always leave the board in a
    // playable state. Reversi can be implemented using these two functions.
